# SylviaEngine

## Overview

I've made a bunch of games over the years, and almost all of them have been with Unity. Unity is a great game engine, but for a lot of projects it's overkill: the projects end up being very large and needing more resources than necessary to run. I've been wanting to unshackle myself from the proprietary game engine world and make something on my own, but of course this is a very large undertaking. For this reason I've started very small, the SylviaEngine is made for a single type of game, namely old-school RPG games.
